If I were starting DevOps from scratch — here are 4 projects I wouldn’t miss
(beginner → AI-based advanced)

1. CI/CD Pipeline with Docker & GitHub Actions (Beginner)
Set up a pipeline to automatically build, test, and deploy a containerized app.
↳ Tools: Git, Docker, K8s, GitHub Actions
↳ Youtube: https://lnkd.in/drS5DKXz

2. Kubernetes Deployment with Monitoring (Intermediate)
Deploy a sample app to Kubernetes and set up Prometheus + Grafana dashboards.
↳ Tools: Kubernetes, Helm, Prometheus, Grafana
↳ Youtube: https://lnkd.in/dsjiwJ_d

3. Infrastructure as Code with Terraform (Advanced)
Provision VMs, storage, and networking on a cloud provider using IaC.
↳ Tools: Terraform, Azure
↳ Youtube: https://lnkd.in/ds_Y5xhn

4. AI-Driven Predictive Scaling (Next-Gen)
Use KEDA + ML models to autoscale workloads before spikes occur.
↳ Tools: Kubernetes, KEDA, Python (forecasting models)
↳ GitHub: https://lnkd.in/d5C5ie8V

With AI taking center stage, DevOps is no longer just about CI/CD pipelines.

RoadMap
That's a really honest realization—and a powerful one. If you're feeling stuck because of **lack of real-world project experience**, here's how to **break out of that cycle** and **build portfolio-worthy DevOps projects**, even without a job or a company.

---

## ✅ The Plan: Go From "No Projects" → "Real Projects" Without Waiting for a Job

---

### 🔧 1. **Build Real-World Simulated Projects (Solo, But Realistic)**

These aren’t tutorials—you **build from scratch**, using real tools, as if working in a team.

#### ✅ Project #1: CI/CD Pipeline for a Web App

* **Stack**: GitHub → Jenkins → Docker → EC2
* **What You Do**:

  * Write a Dockerfile for a simple Node.js or Python app
  * Create Jenkins pipeline for build/test/deploy
  * Host app on EC2 with NGINX reverse proxy
* **What It Shows**: CI/CD, Dockerization, Linux server setup

#### ✅ Project #2: Kubernetes Microservices App

* **Stack**: 3 microservices → Docker → Kubernetes (minikube or kind)
* **Add-ons**: Helm chart + Prometheus monitoring
* **What It Shows**: Real orchestration experience + observability

#### ✅ Project #3: Terraform Infra as Code on AWS

* **Stack**: Terraform + AWS (EC2, S3, RDS)
* **What You Do**:

  * Provision EC2 for app, RDS for DB, S3 for backups
  * Add output variables, modules, and input files
* **What It Shows**: Cloud, IaC, modular thinking

---

### 📁 2. **Organize Your Work as a Public Portfolio**

* Upload to **GitHub** with proper structure:

  ```
  project-name/
  ├── README.md (with diagram + instructions)
  ├── terraform/
  ├── jenkins/
  ├── docker/
  └── screenshots/
  ```

* Add a **video walkthrough** on YouTube or Loom

* Write a **LinkedIn post or Medium blog**:
  *“Here’s how I built a real-world CI/CD pipeline using Docker and Jenkins for a Node.js app”*

---

### 🤝 3. **Collaborate on Open Projects or Start One**

#### Options:

* Contribute to **open-source DevOps tools** (start with GitHub issues labeled `good first issue`)
* Join beginner-friendly communities:

  * [DevOps Discords](https://discord.com/invite/devops), [First Contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions)
* Start your own:

  * *“DevOpsify a legacy project”* → Take any open-source app and add Docker, CI/CD, Terraform to it

---

### 💼 4. **Document + Pitch It as Real Experience**

Don’t say:

> “I’m learning DevOps.”

Say:

> “I’ve built 3 infrastructure pipelines including Dockerized apps, CI/CD automation with Jenkins, and AWS provisioning using Terraform.”

Add them to resume:

```
DevOps Projects (Freelance/Personal)
- Built end-to-end CI/CD pipeline for Python microservice using GitHub Actions, Docker, and Kubernetes
- Automated AWS infra provisioning using Terraform for a 3-tier architecture with EC2, RDS, and S3
```

---

### ⚡ Final Tip: Build 1 → Iterate → Share → Repeat

🚀 **Don’t wait for a job to start a project. Do the project, and the job will follow.**

---

If you want, I can:

* Build a **custom project roadmap** based on your current tools
* Give you a **project template with README + GitHub structure**
* Help you **turn one of these projects into a case study for job applications**

Just say the word. You're closer than it feels—you just need a push into **"creator mode"**.
